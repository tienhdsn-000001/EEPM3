# Contributing to EEPM3

Welcome to the **Expandable Epigenetic Profile Mimicry Module by Mutation (EEPM3)**! We are glad you are interested in contributing to the project. This computational architecture tackles the inverse problem of genomic design, and we welcome improvements to its mathematical optimization, architectural efficiency, and biological priors.

To ensure stability and maintain a high standard of code rigor, please follow the guidelines below.

## 🍴 Fork & Pull Request (PR) Model

**Direct pushes to the `main` branch are strictly restricted.** All contributions must go through the Pull Request review process.

1. **Fork** the repository to your personal GitHub account.
2. **Clone** your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/EDM3.git
   cd EDM3
   ```
3. **Create a feature branch** from `main`. Name it descriptively:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/optimization-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/bug-description
   ```
4. **Commit your changes** with clear, concise commit messages.
5. **Push** your branch to your forked repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/optimization-name
   ```
6. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)** against the `main` branch of the upstream EEPM3 repository.

## 🐛 Bug Reports & Feature Requests

**Please use the GitHub Issues tab to report bugs or request features before writing any code.** 

If you encounter an unexpected error, a convergence failure, or an API polling issue, check the existing issues first. If your issue is new, open a detailed bug report specifying:
- Your execution environment (e.g., Colab, local GPU, driver version).
- The exact error traceback.
- Steps to reproduce the bug.

If you have a major architectural feature request or optimization proposal, opening an issue allows the maintainers to discuss the approach with you *before* you invest time in coding.

## 🧬 Biological Priors & Model Integration
We are particularly interested in contributions involving:
- **Optimization of foundation model priors** (e.g., Evo-2 7B/40B optimization for consumer GPUs).
- **Integration of alternative foundation models** (e.g., Caduceus, GenSLM).
- **Refinement of the AlphaGenome reward interface** for multi-modal data.

Thank you for your interest in advancing epigenetic inverse design!
