## 🧬 Abstract: The Inverse Epigenetic Problem

Traditional genomic models focus on the **Forward Problem**: predicting biological function from a fixed DNA sequence ($X \rightarrow Y$). While valuable for diagnostics, this approach does not provide an actionable path for therapeutic intervention.

**EDM3** solves the **Inverse Problem**. Built on the Generative Flow Network (GFlowNet) framework, EDM3 identifies the precise sequence of mutations ($X_{mutated}$) required to transition a genomic state toward a desired epigenetic profile ($Y_{target}$). By treating genomic editing as a sequential decision process, the engine mimics the demographic shifts of mutation patterns to find high-reward, diverse therapeutic targets.

## 🚀 Core Features (The SOTA Stack)

EDM3 implements a state-of-the-art sparse training pipeline designed for high-concurrency cloud environments:

*   **Asynchronous API Polling**: A fault-tolerant worker system that decouples trajectory generation from scoring. It features exponential backoff and localized SQLite persistence to survive server-side rate limits and session resets.
*   **$\alpha$-GFN Objective**: A hybrid objective function that balances off-policy exploration with on-policy stability.
*   **Sub-Trajectory Evaluation Balance (Sub-EB)**: Enhances the credit assignment problem by evaluating intermediate states, allowing the model to learn from partial paths rather than just final rewards.
*   **Retrospective Backward Synthesis (RBS)**: A data augmentation technique that "hallucinates" alternative mutation orders for high-reward trajectories, increasing the training signal density by 1.5x without additional API costs.

## 📐 Mathematical Foundation

The engine is optimized using the **Trajectory Balance (TB)** loss, which ensures that the flow consistency is maintained across the state space. The learned partition function $Z$ represents the total reward volume, allowing for diverse sampling proportional to the reward.

$$L_{TB} = \left(\log Z + \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} \log P_F(a_t|s_t) - \log R(x) - \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} \log P_B(s_t|s_{t+1})\right)^2$$

Where:
- $Z$: Learnable global flow (partition function).
- $P_F$: Forward policy (probability of choosing a mutation).
- $P_B$: Backward policy (fixed/learned probability of undoing a mutation).
- $R(x)$: The reward scalar returned by the AlphaGenome API.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The EDM3 pipeline is executed in three distinct stages:

1.  **`1_trajectory_sampler.py`**: Generates a diverse set of initial trajectories using a vectorized JAX-based Conv1D policy.
2.  **`2_api_worker.py`**: Orchestrates high-throughput asynchronous polling to the AlphaGenome API to score sequence mutations.
3.  **`3_offline_trainer.py`**: Executes the $\alpha$-GFN Sub-EB training loop to optimize the mutation policy (powered by `offline_trainer_v2.py`).

## ⚡ Quick Start (Google Colab / Kaggle)

EDM3 is optimized for cloud GPUs (T4/L4).

1.  **Mount Google Drive**: Ensure persistence by mounting drive to `/content/drive`.
2.  **Authentication**: Add your `ALPHA_GENOME_API_KEY` to your environment or Colab Secrets.
3.  **Execution**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tienhdsn-000001/EDM3.git
    cd EDM3
    bash run_overnight.sh
    ```
    The script automatically symlinks outputs to `My Drive/EDM3_Data` for crash-safe resumption.

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

In recent production runs, EDM3 demonstrated robust convergence and efficiency:

*   **Convergence**: Successfully validated at **Epoch 82**.
*   **Efficiency**: Achieved a **14.30% EMA loss reduction** within 200 epochs.
*   **Architecture**: Optimized dual-head GeneratorPolicyV2 with **34,136 parameters** (providing high-capacity reasoning within a sparse footprint).
*   **Throughput**: Scored 5,000 trajectories ($L=100,000$ bp) in ~30 minutes.
