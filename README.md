### Abstract
Traditional genomic AI models like AlphaGenome focus on the **Forward Problem**: predicting epigenetic functions and expression from a given, fixed DNA sequence ($X \rightarrow Y$). **EEPM3** solves the **Inverse Problem**: utilizing Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), EEPM3 predicts the exact DNA sequence mutations required to force a cell into a specific, target epigenetic state ($Y_{target} \rightarrow X_{mutated}$).

## 1. The Architecture (SOTA 2026 GFlowNets)

To operate on astronomically large state spaces (100,000 base pairs) without destroying VRAM, EEPM3 implements several cutting-edge architectural decisions.

### Dual-Head Conv1D Policy (34k Parameters)
The `GeneratorPolicyV2` is an ultra-lightweight, dual-head convolution architecture comprising exactly **34,136 parameters**. Instead of $O(N^2)$ attention mechanisms, it uses 1D convolutions aggressively compressed over the sequence length. This bypasses the catastrophic $100kb \times 5$ memory explosion that plagues standard reinforcement learning sequence models.

### Sub-EB & $\alpha$-GFN
Traditional GFlowNets evaluate loss only at the terminal state, creating an impossible credit assignment problem across hundreds of mutation steps. EEPM3's Value head enables **Sub-Trajectory Evaluation Balance (Sub-EB)**, generating dense intermediate reward signals.

The exploration/exploitation trade-off is controlled by the mathematical **$\alpha$-GFN** parameter, which mixes on-policy flow limits with off-policy exploration. The core Trajectory Balance loss utilized is:

$$
L_{TB} = \left(\log Z + \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} \log P_F(a_t|s_t) - \log R(x) - \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} \log P_B(s_t|s_{t+1})\right)^2
$$

### Retrospective Backward Synthesis (RBS)
Because querying biological oracles (the API) is the primary latency bottleneck, EEPM3 implements Retrospective Backward Synthesis. Once a highly rewarded state is discovered, the augmenter hallucinates valid alternative mutation permutations (trajectories) that arrive at the same terminal state. This enables zero-cost data augmentation, expanding the training buffer without making additional API calls.

## 2. Biological Priors & Reward Function

The reward function $R(x)$ enforces both epigenetic target similarity and fundamental biological viability.

### Masked Modality Loss ($\mathcal{L}_{mask}$)
AlphaGenome API tracks are often highly fragmented or unmeasured in clinical data. To prevent gradient explosion (`NaN` leakage) from missing data, the delta between the inference and target is computed behind a strict boolean mask $M$:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{mask} = \frac{\sum (AG(x) - T)^2 \cdot M}{\sum M}
$$

### Evo-2 Foundation Model Prior ($\log P_{Evo}$)
Deep reinforcement learning agents are notorious for discovering "adversarial" solutions—sequences that trick the reward API into outputting a high score, but are biologically lethal (e.g., massive poly-A tracts). EEPM3 guards against this by using the log-likelihood from an authentic foundational DNA language model (**Evo-2**) as a biological guardrail. 

> [!NOTE]
> **Integration Status:** The initial convergence benchmarks (March 2026) were verified using a lightweight, deterministic surrogate proxy to validate the GFlowNet architecture. We are currently actively migrating to full **Evo-2 7B** inference for production-grade biological regularization.

## 3. The Decoupled "Fire & Forget" Pipeline

EEPM3 is built for fault-tolerant execution in cloud environments, separated into a 3-stage asynchronous process:

1. **`1_trajectory_sampler.py` (GPU)**: Rapid, vectorized JAX sequence generation traversing the mutational space.
2. **`2_api_worker.py` (CPU)**: An async API polling worker that scores candidates against the AlphaGenome endpoints. It implements robust exponential backoff to handle `429 Too Many Requests` and `503 Service Unavailable` errors.
3. **`3_offline_trainer.py` (GPU)**: Imports the RBS-augmented SQLite replay buffer and executes offline JIT-compiled Sub-EB gradient training.

## 4. Quick Start / Usage

Clone the repository and install dependencies in your Python 3.10+ environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tienhdsn-000001/EDM3.git
cd EDM3
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Export your secure AlphaGenome API key:

```bash
export ALPHA_GENOME_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

Execute the decoupled orchestrator (handles sampling, scoring, augmentation, and training):

```bash
### 4.2 Model Customization & Hardware Requirements
You can customize the underlying Evo-2 foundation model size based on your available VRAM. **Note:** The 7B model is the strictly recommended target for T4 GPUs as it is designed for bfloat16 accuracy without specialized FP8 hardware.

| Model Size | VRAM (Approx.) | Precision | Recommended GPU | Accuracy Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Evo2 1B** | ~8GB | FP8 | Hopper (H100) | Low accuracy in BF16 |
| **Evo2 7B** | ~15GB - 16GB | **BF16** | **Colab T4 (Target)** | SOTA on consumer GPUs |
| **Evo2 40B** | 80GB+ | FP8 | A100/H100 | Requires FP8/Hopper |

To switch models, export the environment variable before running the pipeline:

```bash
export EVO2_MODEL_NAME="evo2_7b" # Default (Validated for T4)
bash run_overnight.sh
```

## 5. March 2026 Benchmarks

In our latest strictly validated execution run on a 16GB GPU:
- **Sequence Target**: 100,000 base pairs (N-padded to 131,072 bp to meet API constraints).
- **Target Modality**: DNASE Accessibility.
- **Convergence**: Statistical convergence achieved at **Epoch 82**.
- **Model Efficiency**: 34,136 parameters successfully navigated the domain to hit a mathematically validated **14.30% EMA loss drop** across the offline replay buffer.

## 6. Collaboration & Disclaimer

The EEPM3 engine is functionally modular and computationally convergent. We are actively seeking collaboration with researchers who possess processed clinical multi-omic tensors for the next phase of validation.

> **Disclaimer**: EEPM3 is a pre-alpha computational architecture designed to solve the VRAM and latency bottlenecks of inverse genomic design. It currently demonstrates mathematical optimization convergence against proxy and unvalidated API targets. It is not yet clinically validated. Do not use this for clinical decision-making or real-world biological synthesis without rigorous wet-lab validation.
